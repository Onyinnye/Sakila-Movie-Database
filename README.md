# Sakila Movie Database
I am currently enrolled in the programming for data science with Python and I just completed my first project where I queried the Sakila Movie Database with SQL.
 I'm really exicted about this project because I had a chance to put my SQL skill to practice with a real life data.
 for this Project, I focused on finding out:
  - The most rented movies for each category
  - The monthly total payment for the top 10 customers in 2007
  - Counts of movie rentals by countries
  - Family friendly movies classified by their rental duration and rental count
I finally visualized my results with Tableau
